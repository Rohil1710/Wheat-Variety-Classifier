# Principal Component Analysis and Clustering Project

This is an independent machine learning project focused on classifying wheat kernels based on their geometrical properties into specific types. The project utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to reduce the dataset's dimensionality and identify meaningful patterns. The final goal is to accurately classify the wheat varieties using a Gradient Boosting classifier. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: To understand the distribution and relationships between different features of the wheat kernel dataset.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance.
- **Clustering**: Identifying and visualizing clusters in the data to classify different wheat varieties.
- **Model Selection**: Implementing and evaluating a Gradient Boosting classifier to handle the multiclass classification problem.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding, visualization, and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing PCA, clustering algorithms, and the Gradient Boosting classifier.

## Dataset

The dataset contains measurements of seven geometrical properties of wheat kernels, specifically from three wheat varieties: Kama, Rosa, and Canadian. The dataset was collected at the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin and is publicly available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds).

## Conclusion

This project was undertaken independently as a demonstration of my data analysis, machine learning, and Python programming skills. The analysis provides insights into the classification of wheat varieties based on their geometrical properties using PCA and Gradient Boosting.
